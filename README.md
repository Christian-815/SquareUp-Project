# Meetup Clone, renamed SquareUp

## Intro

First fullstack project to make a copy of the website Meetup. I decided to change the theme of the website
to a website designed for fighting game fans. I wanted to give those fans a platform that was focused solely on
creating groups and events for competitive or casual play. From my experience in the fighting game community,
there currently isn't a platform focused solely on fighting games, which are games that thrive on competitiveness
and having groups of people to practice with. That led me to name my clone SquareUp which is a term used to
insinuate that a person wants to fight.
